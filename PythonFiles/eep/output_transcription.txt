2018-08-07 19:20:35 now let's see where this idea of humanistic that I might lead us if we
2018-08-07 19:20:40what is beyond what's the kind of augmentation that we would all like to have
2018-08-07 19:20:44 well how about cognitive enhancement
2018-08-07 19:20:45 inside out
2018-08-07 19:20:53how smart can we make our machines less ask how smart can Irish Ian's make us
2018-08-07 19:20:55 how do you take
2018-08-07 19:21:08memory is the
2018-08-07 19:21:16our memories they Decay over time I mean like where do the sixties go and can I go there too
2018-08-07 19:21:18 what if you could have
2018-08-07 19:21:22scooters computer memory
2018-08-07 19:21:29 and it's about your life

2018-08-07 19:26:36and Tim bali's and cowbell so it was fun but it involved no marching and I was just so devastated
2018-08-07 19:26:47nothing was going to stop me from play stare down with the marching band in the halftime show so my family and I work with an engineer
2018-08-07 19:26:57design a snare drum harness that would be lighter and easier for me to carry and so after continuous work
2018-08-07 19:27:02stair drum apparatus that weighs only about 6 lb
2018-08-07 19:27:07 I just leaving to go
2018-08-07 19:27:17formation about Progeria
2018-08-07 19:27:28and effects of Progeria include light skin like a pig gain stunted growth and heart disease last
2018-08-07 19:27:38my mom and her team of scientists publish the first successful Progeria treatment study and because of this
2018-08-07 19:27:48should ask me the question what is the most important thing that people should know about you and my answer was simply
2018-08-07 19:27:54happy life
2018-08-07 19:27:58 so even though they
2018-08-07 19:28:08created by Progeria I don't want people to feel bad for me I don't think about these
2018-08-07 19:28:18so I'm here today share with you my Philosophy for a happy life
2018-08-07 19:28:32the quote from the famous Ferris Bueller the first Aztec to My Philosophy is that I'm okay
2018-08-07 19:28:42sometimes ask me questions like isn't it hard living with progeria or what daily challenges are
2018-08-07 19:28:53have progeria most of my time is spent thinking about things that
2018-08-07 19:29:04when I can't do something like when a long distance
2018-08-07 19:29:15I choose to focus on the activities that
2018-08-07 19:29:26however
2018-08-07 19:29:41put those things in the end you category
2018-08-07 19:31:57I feel like
2018-08-07 19:36:22as you can see

2018-08-08 10:43:56the pub
2018-08-08 10:44:09it's like a toll road type basis which alleviate some traffic from the surface streets as well
2018-08-08 10:44:20how many levels of tunnel you can have it you can go much for the deep and you can go up the deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are told
2018-08-08 10:44:30you can leave any arbitrary level of open congestion with it with a 3DS home network is a very important points
2018-08-08 10:44:41if you add one layer tunnels then that was supposedly they could definitely get used up and
2018-08-08 10:44:54NE lottery number of tunnels any number of levels
2018-08-08 10:45:04La Subway extension which is a fungus a two and a half mile extension that was just completed for 2 billion dollars so it's roughly
2018-08-08 10:45:19JB the subway extension in LA
2018-08-08 10:45:33flights in the cost per mile of tunneling and how could you check that
2018-08-08 10:45:44so that the first thing to do is to cut The Telltale diameter by factor of two or more single Lane tunnel wood
2018-08-08 10:45:5536ft maybe 28 feet in diameter to allow 4 crashes and emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation of 4
2018-08-08 10:46:05if you strike that diameter
2018-08-08 10:46:17the cross-sectional area by buy Factor 4 so the timing
2018-08-08 10:46:27total for half the time then I stopped and then the rest of the time
2018-08-08 10:46:37continuous tunneling and reinforcing I will give you a factor of
2018-08-08 10:46:47thermal limit so you can jack up the power to the machine substantially
2018-08-08 10:46:58so straightforward series of steps to get
2018-08-08 10:47:08pet snail called Gary from Gary the snail from South Park
2018-08-08 10:47:18so Gary is capable of
2018-08-08 10:47:31in a tunnel Boring Machine okay

2018-08-08 11:08:51tell him I like things are flying this is not some inherent bias against flying things but there is a challenge with flying cars in
2018-08-08 11:09:04the quite noisy the wind Force generator to be very high that this
2018-08-08 11:09:06place
2018-08-08 11:09:13 that is not an excited and eggs iety reducing situation
2018-08-08 11:09:14 you don't think twice
2018-08-08 11:09:27well I feel better about today
2018-08-08 11:09:37I'm so fancy Funnel Vision in future cities with this is Rich 3-g Network channels
2018-08-08 11:09:41could you apply these

2018-08-09 14:42:25exactly
2018-08-09 14:42:28 about lot of people think that once when you may cause of tournaments that
2018-08-09 14:42:38pastor and that will alleviate congestion I just don't agree that would be true but once you have share of autonomy where it's
2018-08-09 14:42:43pick up my car and you no points and points

2018-08-09 16:00:34it's really easy if you say I'm going to be really good at one specific around that's one thing but I think it should be able to go
2018-08-09 16:00:47very good to me once you enter the highway to go anywhere on the highway system in a given country
2018-08-09 16:01:17set
2018-08-09 16:01:27will check if it is not you know how do you make it work say 99.9% of the time
2018-08-09 16:01:33probably so lucky to be comfortable falling asleep
2018-08-09 16:01:46 I bet you know you shouldn't be so
